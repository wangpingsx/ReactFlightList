# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
- `bpk-component-button`  for buttons
- `react-bootstrap`  for using grid to control layout
- `bootstrap` same as above

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

(Default) `npm start`

---

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
- I would like to remove `Boostrap` and spend more time on learning `bpk` components and the design guideline.
- Clean the code.
- Jest test.
- Create backend API to host the json file.
- Improve the style, to make it much closer to the example picture.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
- Nothing very outstanding from my point of view. this test doesn't cover full `fullstack`, which could be my streight. if I have to say one thing, then my streight is angular for frontend, I don't have musch experience of React, but I don't want to hide, a lot of things here are very new to me. e.g. my React projects use xx.js instead of xx.jsx

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
- Styling, try to copy the style from the image.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
- This is a very good test. but it doesn't cover the full `fullstack`, it is testing frontend only. But this is still very good, If I give people tests, i will design something like this.
